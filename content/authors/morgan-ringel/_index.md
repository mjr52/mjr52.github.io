Hi! I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt University. I am advised by Dr. Michael Miga in the Biomedical Modeling Laboratory which is affiliated with the Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE). My research is focused on developing a computer-assisted surgery system for breast conserving surgery.

I am honored to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.
