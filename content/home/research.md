### Image-guidance system for breast surgeries

Breast-conserving surgery is a common treatment option for early-stage breast cancer, but reoperation procedures are common with ~17% of patients having to return to the operating room for a second surgery because of recurrence due to incomplete excisions. Current tumor localization technologies do not provide surgeons with enough information to excise lesions accurately and completely. This clinical need presents an opportunity to use 3D computer vision combined with biomechanical simulation models to create a more advanced computer-assisted surgery navigation system.
